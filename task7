# Task7: Mathematics Behind Machine learning

Task 7 is centered around gaining a deeper understanding of the mathematical constructs that serve as the backbone for machine learning algorithms.

## Curve Fitting:
- The first task requires modeling a curve fitting for a simple function of your choice. This can be achieved using visualization tools like Desmos.
- The process involves selecting a function, gathering data points, and using mathematical techniques to create a curve that best fits the data.
*Steps Involved:*
- For Curve Fitting:
   1. Select a simple function that you want to model, such as a polynomial or trigonometric function.
   2. Collect data points by evaluating the chosen function for various input values.
   3. Use mathematical techniques like least squares regression to fit a curve to the data points.
   4. Visualize the curve-fitting results using tools like Desmos or other graphing software.
