# Task7: Mathematics Behind Machine learning

Task 7 is centered around gaining a deeper understanding of the mathematical constructs that serve as the backbone for machine learning algorithms.

## Curve Fitting:
- The first task requires modeling a curve fitting for a simple function of your choice. This can be achieved using visualization tools like Desmos.
- The process involves selecting a function, gathering data points, and using mathematical techniques to create a curve that best fits the data.

*Steps Involved:*

   1. Select a simple function that you want to model, such as a polynomial or trigonometric function.
   2. Collect data points by evaluating the chosen function for various input values.
   3. Use mathematical techniques like least squares regression to fit a curve to the data points.
   4. Visualize the curve-fitting results using tools like Desmos or other graphing software.

## Fourier transforms:

Fourier transforms, a crucial tool for approximating complex functions. You'll model a Fourier transform for a function of your choice using MATLAB.
- This task delves into the mathematical concepts behind Fourier transforms, which are widely used in signal processing and image analysis.

  *Steps Involved:*
   1. Choose a function that you want to analyze and approximate using Fourier transforms.
   2. Utilize MATLAB, a popular platform for signal processing, to implement Fourier transforms.
   3. Understand the mathematical concepts behind Fourier transforms, which involve decomposing complex signals into a sum of sinusoidal functions.
   4. Visualize the transformed signal and its components to gain insights into the frequency-domain representation.
